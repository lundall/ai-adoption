# About Little People

Little People is a child care organization with 10 schools that provide care and education to young children. They are committed to providing high-quality care and education, but they face some challenges. One challenge is that they have a lot of administrative tasks that take up a lot of time and resources. Another challenge is that they want to improve the communication with parents and the learning experience for children.

To address these challenges, Little People decided to adopt artificial intelligence (AI). They developed an AI vision and goals that align with their business objectives and priorities. They want to use AI to:

- **Enhance** the learning experience for children by providing personalized learning plans and adaptive assessments.
- **Improve** communication with parents by providing real-time updates on their child's progress and sending personalized notifications.
- **Streamline** administrative tasks by automating tasks such as scheduling, billing, and inventory management.

Little People is modeling their enterprise architecture to plan their AI adoption process. This includes the following aspects of their enterprise architecture:

- **Business processes**: Little People is modeling their business processes, such as the process for enrolling children, the process for providing care and education, and the process for communicating with parents.
Applications: Little People is modeling their applications, such as the child management system, the parent portal, and the learning management system.
- **Data**: Little People is modeling their data, such as the data about children, the data about parents, and the data about the organization's operations.
- **Technology**: Little People is modeling their technology infrastructure, such as the servers, storage devices, and network.
Little People is using this model to identify the different AI capabilities that they need to develop or adopt, and to map those capabilities to their business goals and objectives. 

They are also using the model to **identify the different stakeholders** who will be involved in the AI adoption process, and to define the roles and responsibilities of those stakeholders.

Little People believes that modeling their enterprise architecture is a valuable tool for helping them to adopt AI successfully. The model helps them to communicate their vision and goals to stakeholders, to understand the different components of their enterprise architecture, and to plan their AI adoption process.
