### 1.2. Scope and context
The scope of this document is to present Little People’s architecture vision, which is a high-level description of the desired future state of their enterprise architecture. This document will cover the key components and relationships of Little People’s enterprise architecture, including their business processes, information systems, and technology infrastructure. It will also describe how Little People plans to use ArchiMate, a portable and flexible framework for enterprise architecture modeling, to support their business strategy and address their challenges.

The context of this document is Little People’s current situation and challenges. Little People is a child care organization with 10 schools that provide care and education to young children. The organization is committed to providing high-quality care and education, but it is facing some challenges. One challenge is that it has a lot of administrative tasks that take up a lot of time and resources. Another challenge is that it wants to improve the communication with parents and the learning experience for children. Adopting an Enterprise Architecture allowed Little People to develop relevant processes, analysis, and documentation to ensure the alignment of information systems to their business goals and objectives. This allowed them to develop a holistic approach to achieve their business strategy, improve business processes and information, and reduce IT costs.
### 1.3. Stakeholders and concerns
The stakeholders of Little People’s enterprise architecture are the individuals or groups who have an interest or influence in the organization’s architecture. They include the following:
