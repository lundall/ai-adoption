<summary><b>Objectives:</b></br>This section states the goals of Phase C, which are to develop the Target Architectures for the Data and Application domains, and to identify the gaps and roadmap components for the transition from the Baseline to the Target Architectures. </summary>

## 1. Objectives
The objective of this document is to outline, in detail, the information systems architecture of Little People. As part of the following sections, this document will outline the approaches used, the baseline and target data architecture and the baseline and target application architecture including their relevant Gap analysis and roadmap components.

<details> 
<summary><b>Approach:</b></br>This section explains the methodology and sequence of Phase C, which can vary depending on whether the organization takes a data-driven or an application-driven approach. It also describes how ArchiMate, a framework for enterprise architecture modeling, is used to support the development of the Information Systems Architectures.</summary>
